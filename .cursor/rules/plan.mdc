# Plan for Implementation

This document defines the structure and workflow for managing implementation planning through the `plan` folder.

---

## plan Folder Structure

The `plan` folder contains the core planning files, all in Markdown format. These files work together to capture the current state of implementation and to plan the next steps:

```mermaid

    AC[activeContext.md] --> P[progress.md]
```

### Core Files (Required)

1. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations
   - Important patterns and preferences
   - Learnings and project insights

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions


## Core Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> readDocs[Read Docs]
    readDocs --> createPlan[Create Plan]
    readDocs --> |don't exist| createDocs[Create Docs]
    createPlan --> Documents[Documents in Chat]
```

## Plan Updates

Plan updates occur when:

1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update plan** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification 

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Read `docs` and `plan`]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]
        
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    
    Start --> Process
```

Note: When triggered by **update plan**, I MUST review every docs file and plan file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The plan is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.
